## What this repository will contain ?

If you are not French you don't know but there is a website that showed in July 2022 if I'm correct that choose randomly a streamer each `10 mins` with less than `5 active viewers` and that is streaming for at least `15 mins` to embed its stream in the website and let anyone watch it(you can write in their chat etc.. you just need to connect your twitch account)

## When will it be published ?

I don't know, they told me they planned a repository for it so I will wait and if it doesn't come out I will release my version !

## Goals ?

- Remake it as simple as possible programmatically
- Add a verification if a stream stop the stream before the 10 mins timer to switch to another streamer directly (because who tf want to wait the end of timer ? It kill time for no reason !). 
- Add a system to let user decide if they want their channel to be discoverable with the website.

## Optional Goals ?

- Make the website users able to choose a country they want to see the stream for.(i.e: France ;))
  - Make the website having different moderations team depending which country you select.
